# BusSign
Code repo for the Awkward Engineer BusSign

The [Bus Sign](https://www.awkwardengineer.com/collections/in-development/products/model-awk-108-bussign) is a piece of Dedicated Single Purpose Hardware, made specifically for connecting to the NextBus API and displaying when the next bus will arrive on any one of the four routes that are near my house.

## How to Read The Sign

The Bus Sign displays the time (in minutes) for the next two approaching buses on each route. So for example, in the second picture below, there is a 101 bus headed to Malden in 3 minutes and another one following in 16 minutes.

If the time is below 1 minute, the display will actually kick over and show seconds. The 89/101 bus to Sullivan currently shows a bus in 46 seconds and another bus 10 minutes after that.

The Bus Sign receives updates from the cloud (read in a funny voice... theeee cloooooooooud) every 30 seconds.
